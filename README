As the code is written entirely in Python, the only requirement is to
install virtualenv and install all things in requirements.txt.

However, some geometry libraries are used. After installing requirements.txt,
if it doesn't work, please install the corresponding libraries mentioned by
the error message.

The main function can be called from within main.py, where it will run all
6 test cases one by one and show the results.

The files are organized as follows:

src/nonholonomic_shortest_path/ contains the source code

inputs/ contains various inputs. If you want to test with other inputs,
modify the variable "filenames" in src/nonholonomic_shortest_path/main.py

geom_util.py contains most of the geometric utility implementations.
engine.py is the main path finding implementation.
parse_input.py parses the input from the input files.
draw.py draws the corresponding graphic.
